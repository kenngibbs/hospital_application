# hospital_application

### Under Construction

I will be working on a hospital application using Django, Django Restful Framework, PostgreSQL, React/Redux, and SASS. The other repositories on this account has been purposely simplified for teaching. This application will be a fully featured web application.

Going to create the application using the Django templating language first, then implement the React/Redux, SASS.

### To run the application:
Once the application is cloned or downloaded use the terminal/console to navigate to the hospital_application directory and run ```python manage.py runserver```.
