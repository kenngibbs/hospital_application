# hospital_application

### Under Construction

I will be working on a hospital application using Django, Django Restful Framework, PostgreSQL, React/Redux, and SASS. The other repositories on this account has been purposely simplified for teaching. This application will be a fully featured web application.

Going to create the application using the Django templating language first, then implement the React/Redux, SASS.
